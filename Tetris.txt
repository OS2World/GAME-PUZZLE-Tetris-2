	    TETRIS/2
	    --------

TETRIS/2 is a game of tetris for OS/2. This game is playable as a standalone
program or as a "door"-program within a BBS (e.g. Maximus). For BBS operation
the COMM.DLL (or MAXCOMM.DLL) is needed from Maximus OS/2.

The aim of the game is to fit the blocks falling down in the pit in those
already lying on the bottom of it. If a horizontal level is completely filled,
it disapears. The game is over when the pit is filled up to the top. To fit
the blocks together as good as possible you can use the following keys:

	<left>	= moves the block to the left
	<right> = moves the block to the right
	<up>	= rotates the block clockwise
	<down>	= rotates the block counterclockwise
	<space> = drops the block very fast to the bottom

	In BBS operation the Number keys 2,4,6 and 8 are also allowed.

	The counting of points is affected by the following conditions:

	o blocks with edges give more points than straight ones
	o "random" blocks have a higher level also
	o dropping of blocks adds points proportional to the height


There are some additional keys for the user available.

	<R> toggle "random" shapes ON/OFF
	<B> switch "BEEP" ON/OFF
	<E> exit the game immediately without saving the score



Calling conventions:
--------------------

For normal use:

        TETRIS      [ -l # -n user name -m<filename> ]

For bbs use:

        TETRIS -p # [ -l # -n user name -m<filename> -r # ]


  -p  # 	    gives the handle for the COM device as supplied by the BBS
		    program.

  -r  # 	    gives the time remaining for the user in the BBS; if not
		    supplied there is NO time limit.

  -l  # 	    gives the starting level; if not supplied the user is asked
		    for the starting level wanted.

  -n user name	    gives the username (may be more than one word). If not
                    supplied the user is asked for his name.

  -m <filename>     Filename (including drive and path) of the high score data

    08-88  changes by Wizard of Frobozz

	   - changed to small model for speed

	   - first OS/2 implementation

		* OS/2 version accesses directly the video memory

		* Timing problems makes OS/2 version faster than DOS


    01-91  changes by Markus Noller

	   - OS/2-only version, direct memory access removed

	   - multithread implementation, because old version HOGS the CPU

	   - BBS implementation, uses COMM.DLL of Maximus

		* for NON-BBS operation COMM.DLL is NOT necessary

	   - removed mouse interface

	   - all comments changed from dutch to english


   08-91 further changes by Markus Noller

	   -removed a smaller bug in semaphore handling, which did
	    arise only in OS/2 1.0 systems, fixed now for ALL systems


   12-91 further changes by Markus Noller

	   -included MAXCOMM.DLL, now COMM.DLL *OR* MAXCOMM.DLL
	    can be used by TETRIS/2 in DOOR mode !

   01-92 further changes by Markus Noller

           -included automatic multiline support
           -free filename and directory location for the highscore file
            ("-m" parameter)
